This project uses PCA machine learning from Azure ML to predict anomalies on a weather station system using Arduino.

## Testing
First copy all the required libraries to My Documents / Arduino / libraries.

In order to test this project
First upload the ArduinoCodes/postThingWorxV2/postThingWorxV2.ino to the Arduino MKR1000, edit the code header to match your SSID, Thingworx server, thing name, service name, api key, etc and then monitor through Thingworx Platform that the values change depending on the DHT11 sensor state. Use serial monitor to check the correct SSID association and POST to Thingworx

Note: The DHT11 is directly connected to pin D2 in MKR1000 in the device.

After this works, try testing the Machine Learning uploading the ArduinoCodes/smartHumidV2/smartHumidV2.ino, edit the code header to match your SSID, Thingworx server, thing name, service name, api key, etc and then monitor through Thingworx Platform that the values change depending on the DHT11 sensor state and also inject anomalies to the sensor heating it with hands. After a while, the Arduino In-built LED should turn on and also the Anomaly LED in Thingworx platform indicating that an anomaly occured.
